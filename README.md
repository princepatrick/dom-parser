# dom-parser
A simple implementation of a dom parser.

A DOM parser is a tool that takes up the HTML or XML as the input and converts into tree like objects that make it faster to access and manipulate.

Dom Parsers are used in various use case:
Web Browser: This is primary use case of the DOM Parser where the HTML content is divided into the DOM tree where each node represents the part of the HTML document.
Web Development: The DOM tree is manipulated using the Javascript dom manipulation methods
Web Scraping Tools: The web scraping tools uses the DOM parser to navigate through the html files to pick the value or content from the particular nodes.
Testing Frameworks: Testing tools like Selenium and Puppeteer use dom parsing to interact with the web pages for automated testing
XML Processing applications: Applications that parses, and beautifies XML files uses a similar implementation of the DOM Parser.

In our implementation, we will be working on a dom parser implementation that parses through the HTML files.
